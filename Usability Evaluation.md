# Competency Report - Usability Evaluation

### Evaluate you wireframe by using either heuristic evaluation or user testing.  Take proper notes and discuss what changes, if any, are needed in your design going forward.

#### General Thoughts

The app so far seems fairly basic, with not many options to choose from or complicated navigation. I already like the simplicity. I will continue to strive for a clean and simple UI that is intuitive to use as coding begins.  

I think the most complicated parts I wasn't able to show in the wireframe nor code yet. This will likely be the map functionality and useability. Though, with how often users use maps already in their daily lives, I'm hoping the skill will translate easily.  

I'm researching othher companies that have devolped similar products to see how their UI is done to get ideas.
